## Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

1) Install the latest release of `amici-st` from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/amici-st/>`_:

```bash
pip install amici-st
```

Or install the latest development version via the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/azizilab/amici.git@main
```

2) Import `amici`

```python
import anndata
from amici import AMICI

adata = anndata.read_h5ad("./adata.h5ad")
AMICI.setup_anndata(adata, labels_key="cell_type", coord_obsm_key="spatial")
model = AMICI(adata, **model_params)
model.train()
```
